# My-Post-GRE-SQL-Project-
This is my first Post GRE SQL project.
🚀 Exciting Learning Experience! 🚀
I recently completed an SQL assignment provided by Satish Dhawale, the founder of Skill Course. This assignment involved extracting key insights from a dataset using SQL queries, helping me strengthen my data analysis skills.
Some of the insights I worked on include:
📊 Total number of patients across hospitals
🏥 Top departments with the highest patient count
💰 Hospital with the maximum medical expenses
⏳ Average length of stay per department
I’m excited to share my assignment solutions with you all! You can check out the full PDF here. 📎
A big thank you to Satish Dhawale for curating such an insightful and practical learning experience. 🙌
